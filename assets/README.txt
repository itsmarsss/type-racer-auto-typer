INFORMATION: 

	---How To Use---
method #1:
   A. Inspect the Type Racer page and copy the unselectable text
   B. Paste the text into the textbox
   C. Type the first word (because it won't be there when you copied the text)
   D. Press "Type" when there are less than 2 seconds left and click into the type racer textbox

method #2:
   A. Press "Select Text Area"
   B. Press and drag your mouse until the white rectangle covers all the text (It's best to zoom in the website for more accurate results)
   C. Press "Type" when there are less than 2 seconds left and click into the Type Racer textbox

	---This Application---
   - simulates keystrokes to type
   - uses Tesseract OCR to read your selection area
   - reads English by default (can be changed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Type Racer Typer\tessdata" if you know how to)
   - is written in Java (by Marsss)
